<h1>I am done.</h1>
As of today, the 23rd of April, 2024, I, WackyModer, will no longer be a part of the Bopl Battle community in any sense.
<br>
<br>
I do not hate most of the people, but I would like to COMPLETELY remove any of my association with the following.
<br>
<br>
I will add updates on the bottom as they come up.
<br>
<br>
<h2>The people:</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/codemob-dev">Codemob</a>
<br>
<br>
<h2>The projects:</h2>
Splotch
<br>
SplotchLib
<br>
<br>
<h2>Everything else:</h2>
Bopl Battle
<br>
The Bopl Battle modding scene


<h3>No, I am not releasing this domain until this community has properly died. I hate you. I will never come back. I want this to be a permanent shit stain on the community, as the community was on my life.</h3>

<h3>This thankless community has brought me nothing but a waste of time. Goodbye.</h3>

<br>
<br>
<h1>Why</h1>
<br>
This is my second breaking point in this community, and I'm done with this shit.
<br>
<br>
The first time I hit my breaking point I... nearly made some <i>rash</i> decisions. 
I was being pushed too much (in my opinion, go fuck yourself if you have a different one.) and I was just done with this whole mess. 
This community is filled with children, many under the required age to use Discord. They lack the foresight or knowledge to deal with anything. 
major, and lack the skills to deal with genuine issues or have empathy (Not an assumption, I've seen it quite a few times.) 
I have sacrificed so much of my time, to provide entertainment to the needy childish community. They just keep on taking and taking 
with me never getting anything out of it. I am properly done.
<br>
<br>
(The "the community is filled with needy children" is mostly true, I mostly haven't had exposure to the non-dickish side 
because they don't constantly pester me.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Quick side note, if I do die at least you'll know who I am. My initials are ACR. If its on my own accord it will be by a rope or car.
